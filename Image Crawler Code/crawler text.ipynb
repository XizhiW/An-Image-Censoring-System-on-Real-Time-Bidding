      "down the precise effects remains difficult, but the above rules of thumb at least give \n",

      "the economic effects of demographic change.  \n",
      "Above we derived simple estimates of the economic effect of demographic change \n",
      "on the workforce, which suggested that those effects could be in the order of 0.2% \n",
      "per year or 26 million additional workers over 20 years. Could innovation therefore \n",
      "offset the (macro) effects of demographic change? Indeed, embracing automation \n",
      "has been among the strategies being pursued by various countries, including China \n",
      "and Japan, to address demographic developments.  \n",
      "Even though forecasting the contribution of demographic change remains extremely \n",
      "uncertain, we suspect that the answer is therefore quite conceivably yes. For \n",
      "instance, a previous Citi GPS report highlighted that up to 47% of current US \n",
      "employment is at risk of being automated, a report by Deloitte and Frey and \n",

      "potentially see a different picture. For example Japan faces a large demographic \n",

      "In the words of the famous author Elbert Hubbard —- “One machine can do the \n",
      "work of fifty ordinary men, No machine can do the work of one extraordinary man.” \n",
      "With technology advancing at a rapid pace, could Hubbard be right? Do we need to \n",
      "be extraordinary for technology not to take our job?  \n",
      "Over the last few years there have been many academics, industrialists and others \n",
      "that have highlighted, analysed and debated the rapid expansion of automation in \n",
      "the workplace. In our previous Citi GPS report Technology at Work, we concluded \n",
      "that 47% of the jobs in the US are susceptible to automation. In this publication we \n",
      "extend this analysis to other countries and regions and conclude that jobs in \n",
      "developing countries are also susceptible to automation. Due to technological \n",
      "advancement low-wage regions which have traditionally attracted manufacturing \n",
      "firms will not have the same possibility of achieving rapid growth by shifting workers \n",
      "from farms to higher-paying factory jobs -therefore they would need to find a \n",
      "different path to prosperity.  \n",
      "Our analysis also extends to cities, and we conclude that in the US, cities that are \n",
      "more specialised in a certain industry are at high risk of automation, whilst others \n",
      "that have a more diversified industry are more resilient to the expanding scope of \n",
      "automation. Work by Oxford Martin School researchers shows that the cities most \n",
      "at risk include Fresno and Las Vegas, whilst cities least at risk include Boston, \n",
      "Washington D.C and New York. The best way for cities to reduce their exposure to \n",
      "automation is to upskill their workforce.  \n",
      "New jobs are also emerging with forecasts suggesting that there will be 9.5 million \n",
      "new job openings and 98 million replacement jobs in the EU from 2013 to 2025. \n",
      "However our analysis shows that roughly half of the jobs available in the EU would \n",
      "need highly skilled workers, something which is emphasized in both the previous \n",
      "chapters.  \n",
      "In the US, the digital economy is also creating some new jobs, whilst other sectors \n",
      "such as the green economy and industrial sectors are also increasing their job \n",
